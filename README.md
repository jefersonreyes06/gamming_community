# Gaming Community
Connecting gamers through dedicated interest-based hubs.

Gaming Community is a mobile application designed to bridge the gap between players. It solves the common problem of "solo-queue fatigue" by allowing users to join specific communities based on their favorite titles, engage in real-time discussions, and find teammates.

Built as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), the app focuses on speed, real-time synchronization, and a clean user experience.

## Key Features
 - **User Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login powered by Firebase Auth.
 - **Community Discovery**: Browse and join various gaming hubs (e.g., RPG, FPS, eSports).
 - **Real-time Chat**: Instant messaging within communities using Cloud Firestore.
 - **User Profiles**: Customize your gaming identity and see what others are playing.
 - **Dynamic UI**: A responsive and fluid interface built entirely with Flutter.
